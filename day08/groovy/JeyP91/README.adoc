== Groovy

Here is another solution written in Groovy.
First I split the input into a list of commands:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=splitInput]
....

=== Part 1:
Part 1 simply executes all commands until one command is executed the second time:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=executeProgramExecutedCommands]
        ...
    }
....
When the loop stops, the current accumulator is returned

=== Part 2:
In part 2 the execution of the commands is the same.
The program is now not only stopped, if a command is executed the second time, but also if a position is reached, which is higher then the number of commands.
The executeProgram method returns a Tuple, which indicates successful execution and the accumulator.
To test all jmp->nop and nop-jmp, I just iterate over all commands and try to change one at a time until the program executes successfully:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=solvePart2]
....
