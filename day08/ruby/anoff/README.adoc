== Part 1

I implemented a computer class that holds a pointer to the current executed line.
With each execution the pointer position is stored in an array of _visited codelines_, if the pointer has a value that was already added to the array, the program will fail.

Once the fail is detected print the stack value.

== Part 2

For part2 I adapted the error codes of the computer class to detect the scenario of reaching program end.
I ran the program once into its infinite loop and then used the stacktrace (list of executed pointers) to manipulate line by line until the program did terminate correctly.
