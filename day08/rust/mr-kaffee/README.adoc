== Day 8: Handheld Halting ==

Rust solution for https://https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8[AoC 2020, day 8].

Run with `cargo run`

Run some tests based on example data from
https://https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8[puzzle description]
with `cargo test`

=== Part 1 ===

Instructions are modeled as an enum type with some derived traits:

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=instruction]
....

Run program and store positions visited in a set until position repeats:

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=run]
....

=== Part 2 ===

Alter instructions `nop <--> jmp` one by one until the program terminates without repetition:

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=fix]
....
