== Day 6: Custom Customs

This solution is written in Groovy.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6 .
The source code can be found at https://github.com/docToolchain/aoc-2020/tree/main/day06/groovy/rdmueller .

For execution enter `./solution.groovy` in the command line.
This is possible because I looked up the right shebang for the first line of the file to tell bash to use groovy.

=== Star 1

Now this seems to be quite trivial.
This time, I don't parse the file into a map, I just operate on the files.

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=star1]
----

=== Star 2

It does not get much harder...

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=star2]
