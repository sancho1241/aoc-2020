== Groovy

Here is another solution written in Groovy.
First I split the input into a list with blocks of answers:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=splitInput]
....

=== Part 1:
For each block I calculate the unique answers by doing the following:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=countUniqueAnswers]
....
The results for each block of answers will just be summed up:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=sumUniqueAnswers]
....

=== Part 2:
For each block I calculate the common answers by doing the following:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=countCommonAnswers]
....
The results for each block of answers will just be summed up:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=sumCommonAnswers]
....
