== What I learned

. Set manipulation in Python

== Approach

. I read the file in using .readlines.
.. I added an '\n' to the end of my list to simplify things later. (Thanks to the common code respository, I picked up this hint from a solution from a previous day).
. In a for loop, I created 2 list of sets. One for the sets containing all letters used on forms in a group. One for the sets containing only the letters common within a group.
.. For the first list, you just keep on adding letters to a string until the end of the group and then you create a set of that string.
.. For the second list, you initial it with the first person from the group and then create an intersection between it and each further member.
. Then I just sum up the length of the sets in each of the 2 lists and print them.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
