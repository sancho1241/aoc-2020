== AoC - Day 06: Custom Declaration Forms
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6

=== Info

Help passengers with answers to custom declaration form, check all pax groups' 'yes'es

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input06.txt' line by line.
For every group (minding the last without newline) the questions ('a' to 'z') with positive answer are collected.

.Star1: Sum of 'yes'es
. Collect groups total answers into "set" (list with 'doubles' entry check)
. Count and sum

.Star2: Sum of groups' collective 'yes'es - i.e. everyone in group answered question
. New batch: take in all letters
. New line: check whether "group letters" are present, else pop from group letters
. Sum up

=== Learned today

* 'set' vs 'list', nevertheless stuck with list :)
* Don't pop in a running 'for' loop
