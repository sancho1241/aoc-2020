== Day 6: Custom Customs

I am really a fan of Set objects now!
I decided to spent some effort and created a proper data structure to store the custom information.
It is a list containing all the groups. Every group is a list of all group members.
The answer of every group member is represented as a Set.
It took the most time to write the parser for the input.

The rest of tasks was pretty much itterationg through the data structure and using the `union()` (Star 1) and `intersection()` method of the Set object.
