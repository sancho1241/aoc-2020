*General remark*
some minor starting problems today, figured out I need to append a \n to the end of the PuzzleInput, else my for loop won't process the last element. There might be prettier solutions for that :)

*First star*
achieved
1) answers of all groups are combined in a string (= ansgroup), removing all newlines from the list elements before adding them to the string
2) once there is only a \n in the PuzzleInput, the ansgroup is processed by using the set() function to eliminate all duplicates
3) length of ansgroup is added to the count

*Second star*
achieved (using most of the solution of part 1)

difference to part 1:
1) now also counting the size of the groups with k and saving the answers of the first groupmember
2) iterating though the answer of the first groupmember and check if they are k-times in the combined answers. If yes, count is increased by 1
Additional thought: While writing this documentation, I figured to increase speed, I could have iterated through the shortest answer of each group.
