== Day 06

This solution is written in python.

Run using:
$ python solution.py

We split the whole input in chunks with '\n\n' as delimiter,
hence each chunk comprises one group of people.

=== First Star
We make use of set-comprehension to put all the answers of
one group into a set (this takes care of idempotency automatically, i.e. aa = a).
In the main-function we just extract the size of the set of answers
for each group (and add those up).

```python
def get_answers_of_group(group):
    answers = {x for x in group if re.match('[a-z]', x)}
    return answers
```

=== Second Star
The idea is similar as before: the answers given by each person are put in a set and
the sets (=answers from each group) are intersected to get the questions, where everybody
of a single group answered yes.
