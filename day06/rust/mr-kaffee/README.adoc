Run solution with `cargo run`

Run tests on example data with `cargo test`

Today, I wrote my first Rust function accepting a `Fn` as an argument.
This allows to use the same function to solve parts 1 and 2.

Idea: questions for which some-one answered yes are stored as bits of an integer.
Then, for part 1, we start with no bits set and combine results with bitwise or.
For part 2, we start with all bits set and combine results with bitwise and.

The function which achieves this accepts an initial state and a function used to combine results as arguments:

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=part]
....

The call for part 1 looks as follows:

[source,rust]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=part1]
....

The call for part 2 looks as follows:

[source,rust]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=part2]
....
