:day: Day06
= {day}

To run the program, you need JDK 11.
Thanks to http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330], launching is as easy as `java {day}.java`.

== Main method

Read input, call methods for part 1 & 2 and print result:

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=main]
----

== Part 1

Split the groups and then count the distinct letters in each groupo

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=part1]
----


== Part 2

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=part2]
----

(Quick & dirty )

. Split the groups, then the lines of each group.
. For each group, add answers (Character objects) of first person into a set.
. Iterate over answers of all remaining persons and all answers that are not contained in any of the other people's answers
