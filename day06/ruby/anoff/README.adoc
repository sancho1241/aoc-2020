== Part 1

Decided to TDD this day - very limited refactor loop though.
First star was easy to get, just had to be a bit careful with splitting the newlines.
Decided to use a regex to remove duplicates from the answers - this is something I saw a while ago but never used so had to stackoverflow it again.
Using a regex pattern of `\w\1+` matches word characters were any individual character occurs more than once, note the **\** in front of `\1+` that is not there if you simply check for _one or more_ occurrences.

== Part 2

This time my first star implementation almost gave me nothing to work with because of my regex approach for star1 that was completely useless in the second scenario.

== Solution

[source, ruby]

include::solution.rb[]
