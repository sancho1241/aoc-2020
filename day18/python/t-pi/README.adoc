== AoC - Day 18: Operation Order
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18

=== Info

Math homework with special evaluation spoiling known math functions - parentheses still run first

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.

.Star1: Sum up line results with parentheses first, then straight left-to-right evaluation
. Took me some time to wrap my head around
. Get "shadow expression" with parenthesis level at all positions
. Then take first parenthesis at highest level and resolve with straight "left-to-right" evaluation
. Replace resolved parenthesis in expression with string result and re-iterate the level evaluation of the whole expression
. Return last expression result with no more parenthesis from straight evaluation

.Star2: Replace straight left-to-right evaluation with "sums first"
. Add evaluation function which 
.. takes the next sum in expression and resolves it
.. replaces the sum expression with the result and iterates again with the new reduced expression
.. evaluates the remaining expression (with only '*') via the straight evaluation from star 1
. Switch evaluation function depending on star parameter

.Star2 smarter: Inspiration from repo colleagues after finding own approach
. Of course interpretation of parenthesis levels is much easier and straightforward starting with closing parenthesis ðŸ™„
. Thanks once more to the repo and the other participants, in this case I looked up asung's repo first!

=== Learned today

* Assignment in while loop condition possible from python 3.8 on with ':='
* Parsing nested structures
** A more efficient approach to parse parentheses
* If you split by ' ', keep them while reducing the expression...
