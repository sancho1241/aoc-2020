Run the program using "~/.sdkman/candidates/java/current/bin/java Day02.java"

= First star

We are using a stream of all the lines and filter so that only the valid passwords remain. After that we count the number of elemnts of the stream and print it. 

Following steps are performed to check if a password is valid:

1. We are getting the different values we need (minValue, maxValue, ...) by splitting the string and substringing (is this a word?) it. 
2. We are iterating over the password and are increasing a count every time the letter matches the letter we search for. If they match we return true, otherwise false.

= Second star

Since this is for fun we do not care about code duplication. We use the same stream().filter() method and just change the Predicate:

1. Still getting all the values we need
2. We check both at positions if the letters match
3. First check if both positions match -> false
4. We now can check if either one matches. If it does return true.
