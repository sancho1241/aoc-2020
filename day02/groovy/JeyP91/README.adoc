== Groovy

Here is another solution written in Groovy.
Each password is validated for part 1 and part 2. Valid passwords are then simply summed up to get the final solution.

=== Part 1:
From each string the necessary parts are taken out and then validated by checking min and max appearances:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=validatePart1]
....

=== Part 2:
From each string the necessary parts are taken out and then validated by using XOR operator:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=validatePart2]
....
