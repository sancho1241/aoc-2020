== Day 02

This solution is written in python.

Run using:
$ python solution.py

=== First Star
We parse the input line by line using String.split
(yeah this is very brittle .. and we do no error-handling etc.)
after having parsed the input we delegate the checking to
a function "is_valid_first" and count how many times this function returns True.

=== Second Star
The check is implemented in the function "is_valid_second" --
otherwise the behaviour is exactly like for the first exercise.
Exactly one of the positions must equal the letter so we take the
logical 'xor' of the two comparisions.
Further note that 'xor' is logically equivalent to '!='.
