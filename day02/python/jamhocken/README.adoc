== What I learned

. Actually, this one was pretty straightforward for me. Yoohoo!

== Approach

Brute force. I just read in each line of the file and decompose that line
into the constituent parts: First number, second number, character to check,
password candidate. And then I implement an if statement to check the rule.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[]
