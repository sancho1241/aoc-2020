Run solution with `cargo run`

Run tests on example data with `cargo test`

This was my first experience with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression[regular expressions] in Rust.

Created one function `check` which returns a pair of booleans as check results for parts 1 and 2 and use this as follows:

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=count_pass]
....
