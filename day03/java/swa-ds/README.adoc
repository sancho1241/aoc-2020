:day: Day03
= {day}

To run the program, you need JDK 11.
Thanks to http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330], launching is as easy as `java {day}.java`.

== Part 1

=== Create the map

The file is read into a `List<String>` using `Files.readAllLines(...)`.
The map is created with a `Stream` from the list, converting each line into a `char[]`,
and finally collecting everything into a two dimensional char array:

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=createMap]
----

=== Count the trees

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=solution]
----

<1> If we step out of the map to the right, we emerge again on the left (as known from Pac-Man and the like...)

=== Output (Part 1)

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=part1Output]
----

<1> 3 steps to the right, 1 step down

== Part 2

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=part2Output]
----
