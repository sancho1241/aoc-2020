== Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory  ==

This solution is written in Groovy.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3 .
The source code can be found at https://github.com/docToolchain/aoc-2020/tree/main/day03/groovy/rdmueller .

For execution enter `./solution.groovy` in the command line.
This is possible because I looked up the right shebang for the first line of the file to tell bash to use groovy.

=== Read File

This time, I simply split the input into lines.

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=readInput]
----

=== First Star

I need a method to read a map entry.
Then I iterate through the map long enough to get to the bottom.
As a trick, I modified the `readMap` to add virtual space at the bottom.
This allows me to go further down without getting exceptions.

[source,groovy, linenums]

include::solution.groovy[tags=star1]

=== Second Star

Now, do the same for the different sloopes.
