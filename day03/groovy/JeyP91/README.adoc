== Groovy

Here is another solution written in Groovy.
First I split the input into a list with seat strings:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=splitInput]
....

=== Part 1:
Trees are counted by iterating over the lines with right and down pattern:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=countTrees]
....
The pattern repetition problem is solved by simply using modulo on the index with the line length of the pattern:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=patternRepetition]
....
In the pattern line, the position is checked for '.' or '#' and o or 1 is returned:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=getTreeForLine]
....

=== Part 2:
Just call the solution for part 1 with all 5 patterns and calculate the product of the 5 solutions.
