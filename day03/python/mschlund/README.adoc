== Day 03

This solution is written in python.

Run using:
$ python solution.py

We read in the map rowwise into a simple list-of-lists
(each row is already a list, since strings are lists of chars).

=== First Star
The function is parametrized by the slope,
determined by the two parameters stride_x and stride_y.
We simply loop from top to bottom over the map starting from
the position (0,0). In each step we add the slope to the current position,
calculating the x-position modulo the length of a line.

=== Second Star
Using th parametrized function from the first star as subroutine,
this exercise is simplified -- we just call it for each slope and multiply the results.
