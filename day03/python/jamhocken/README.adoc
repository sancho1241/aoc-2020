== What I learned

. It took me a while to get the modulo and integer division right for
problem 1. The breakthrough was to make a simple example with 4 columns and
then it became quite clear. I should have done that earlier and made a simple
test...
. Read the problem statement. I lost a good bit of time by not realizing
the the first line of the file is never evaluated.
. If you give the wrong answer (which I did), there is a one minute time-out
before you can try again. Tested for you! :-)
. Problem 2 was trivial after solving problem 1.

== Approach

I created a function to check whether there was a tree or not. I basically
throw away the first line of the file and then iterate throw the other lines,
checking each of the slopes from Problem 2 (which includes problem 1).

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
