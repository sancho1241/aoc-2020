== Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory

The first challenge of this task is that the map tile is not big enough for the trajectories.
Hence the map must be enhaced by concatinaging suffiecent tiles until it is wide enough.

I decided to enhance the map in advance before calculating the path of the tobbogan.
My other idea was enahcing the map dynamically while calculating the path.
I decided for the first approach since this helps me to keep the two use cases seperated.

After implementing it I talked to an friend and he pointed out that using the modulo operator would have made it possible to only use that one map tile... next time.
