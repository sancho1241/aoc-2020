This solution is written in python.
We are using pipenv to ensure reproducibility
and easy dependeny management.

The exercise defines a directed graph with
edges between colors. An edge u -w-> v with weight w means that a u-colored
bag contains w other bags, colored in v.
The first task is to read in that graph from the input -- to this
end we use regular expressions and the String.split-function to
parse each line of the input-file and to add the extracted edges to
a networkx-digraph G.


=== First Star
We have to count all (direct and indirect) predecessors from the node "shiny gold".
While this would just require a dfs, our solution (although much too cosly for larger graphs)
can be expressed fairly simply:
We compute the transitive closure of the graph and get the number of predecessors
of the "shiny gold"-node in the resulting graph.

```python
transitive_closure = nx.transitive_closure(G)
num_pred = len(list(transitive_closure.predecessors('shiny gold')))
print('We have {} predecessors of "shiny gold"'.format(num_pred))
```

=== Second Star
The basic idea:
We have to get the total weight (=sum of weights) of all paths originating
at the start-vertex "shiny gold".
The weight of a path is basically the product of the weights of its edges
(+ the weight (=number of bags) originating from each vertex).
The computation is done recursively:

```python
def get_total_weight(G, s):
  if G.out_degree(s) == 0:
    return 0
  neighbors = G.successors(s)
  weight_of_neighbors = [(get_total_weight(G, v) + 1) * G[s][v]['weight'] for v in G.successors(s)]
  return sum(weight_of_neighbors)

[...]
    #star 2:
    needed_bags = get_total_weight(G, 'shiny gold')
    print('The shiny gold bag contains {} bags.'.format(needed_bags))
```
