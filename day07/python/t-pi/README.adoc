== AoC - Day 07: Handy Haversacks
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7

=== Info

Bags are stacked in bag -- where could I stash my shiny golden bag?

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.
Recursively pack the bags into dict of (outer color: [(inner color, amount), ...])

.Star1: How many bags can hold directly or indirectly my 'shiny gold' bag?
. Recursively run through dict's inner colors, starting with 'shiny gold'
. Count the amount of bag outer colors


.Star2: How many bags can my 'shiny gold' bag hold in total max?
. Recursively run through dict's outer colors, starting with 'shiny gold'
. Count the amount of actual bags with found inner colors
. Don't count the 'shiny gold' bag... ðŸ™„

=== Learned today

* Working with recursive functions and not get lost with counting and keeping track of doubles
* From other solutions, that I really need to get into ```re```...
