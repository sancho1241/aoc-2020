== Day 7: Handy Haversacks

This day reminded me of some challenges from last years AoC that I did not like.
But after having a closer look the provided information seemed to resemble a structure that I am quite familiar with:
A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)!

After some googling I found the python graph library `networkx`.
I started with parsing the input file and turning the provided information into a graph.
Afterwards I created the recursive methods `get_all_bags_inside_bag` and `get_all_parent_bags` that traverse the graph
to extract the required information from the graph.

In order to run the example you first have to install the `networkx` library e.g. using `pip install networkx`
