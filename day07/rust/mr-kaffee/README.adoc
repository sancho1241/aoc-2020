== Day 7: Handy Haversacks ==

Run solution with `cargo run`

Run tests on example data with `cargo test`

=== Part 1 ===

Part 1 is solved with a breadth first search:

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=explore_parents]
....

=== Part 2 ===

Part 2 is solved with a recursive algorithm:

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=count_children]
....

The algorithm includes the bag itself, i.e., the final result is obtained as

[source,rust]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=sol2]
....
