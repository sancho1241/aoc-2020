== Part 1

Oh god graphs again!

Unsure how to build up the graph though I opted for a graph-esque solution.
I built a class `Bag` that can take the list of all baggage rules and then populate a local array with all the bags that can be stored in the `Bag` instance.
This is done recursively for any `Bag` that does not have this list populated yet.

In the end it is just counting the number of items in the instance of the shiny gold `Bag`.

start
:create <i>Ruleset</i> instance;
while (for each bag rule in input)
  :create <i>Bag</i> instance;
endwhile
while (for each bag in ruleset)
  :get all bag contents recursively:
    - check if child bag is already populated
        with children, otherwise call recursion
    - add child bag type to own <i>contents</i> array
    - count how many child bags there are in <i>contentSize</i>
  ;
endwhile

while (loop through all bags in ruleset)
  if (bag contents
  include "shiny goald") then (Y)
    :add to count;
  endif
endwhile
:print count;
end

== Part 2

My first hacky try to just append each Bag a gazillion times even on the recursive level failed, aborted the computation after a minute üòÅ

The working solution was to just introduce another class variable that represents the total count of all bags in the bag itself.
This was easy to populate using the existing recursive setup and executed in less than a second.
