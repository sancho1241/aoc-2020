== Day 12: Rain Risk ==

Rust solution for https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12[AoC 2020, Day 12]

Run solution with `cargo run` (you can still run `cargo run --release` but I did not add any timers today).

Run tests with `cargo test`

=== Solution ===

The solution is quite straight forward, applying the rules from the puzzle input.

In the second part, you have to figure out how to change `(x, y)`-coordinates when the waypoint rotates about the relative origin (the ship).

I use the following data structures (maybe a bit of overhead):

[source,rust,numbered]
.`Heading` for the heading of the ship
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=Heading]
----

[source,rust,numbered]
.`Step` for a single step
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=Step]
----

[source,rust,numbered]
.`Ship` for state of ship and waypoint
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=Ship]
----

The instructions are applied one by one as follows (with `use_wp = false` for part 1 and `use_wp = true` for part 2):
[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=apply]
----
