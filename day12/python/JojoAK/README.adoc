Day 12 of year 2020
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12

== Approach

. Star 1
.. read input, initialize coordinates with 0
.. go through each command, divide command in action and value
.. use heading mod 360 for standardized heading
.. execute commands accordingly - no big deal today :)
. Star 2
.. introduce new sets of coordinates for waypoint
.. go through each command, divide command in action and value
.. execute commands accordingly
.. trickiest thing of the day: rotating the waypoint around the ships position using some trigonometry
. Hints
.. maybe not so nice that once the waypoint is rotated around the ship, the coordinates become floats. Maybe I should have handled that better. Anyways, still works :)

== Run script
- Run the solution for star 1 with `python Day_12_1.py`
- Run the solution for star 2 with `python Day_12_2.py`
