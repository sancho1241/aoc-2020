== AoC - Day 12: Rain Risk
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12

=== Info

Navigation issues: Follow mixed absolute (N,E,S,W) and relative (F,L,R) instructions + distances

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.

.Star1: Find traveled Manhattan distance (abs(x)+abs(y))
. Change position and heading line by line & sum up
. Output position

.Star2: Still find Manhattan distance, but moving with waypoint
. Introduce rotation function to rotate waypoint around ship
. Else: s. Star 1

=== Learned today

* Small rotation matrix reminder
* Moving from gitpod to local environment
