== Day 4: Passport Processing

For Star 1 I started to parse the input into dictionaries. One dictionary repesenting the data of one passport.
Afterwards I could simply check if all required keys are being present in a dictionary by creating a list of all available keys using the getKeys() method.
Then I could check if all required keys are in this set by using the issubset() method.

Star 2 was a lot of work due to the amount of checks to be implemented.
I put all the checks in one big if statements. The more complex checks have been outsourced in dedicated functions.
In the end I of by one error because a poorly crafted RegEx captured one object too much.
Looking back I should have decomposed the problem better and could have used TDD to verify smaller units.
