== Advent of Code - Day 04
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4

=== Info

Check passport batches for completeness

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input04.txt' line by line.
Every empty line, the batch is evaluated for all required fields:
 
 - byr (Birth Year)
 - iyr (Issue Year)
 - eyr (Expiration Year)
 - hgt (Height)
 - hcl (Hair Color)
 - ecl (Eye Color)
 - pid (Passport ID)

and an optional

 - cid (Country ID)

.Star1: How many valid passports are found?
. Split into fields
. Parse available field names
. Check against required fields

.Star2: How many passports with valid field content are found?
. Add field specific rule check for validity

=== Learned today

- Don't rely on newline for passport batch check, this leads to missing the last entry
- How to check for valid hexadecimal numbers, while still avoiding `re` :) 

=== Not learned today

Sorry for the soft-linebreak hack in the adoc-README, I just don't like space waste. Any hint on how to locally change the theming of 
`outline_list:
  item_spacing: 1.0`
is appreciated!

==== Update 2020-12-05:

Thanks, Ralf.D.MÃ¼ller for helping me out! Applied the local CSS style for Dec, 05 and transferred it back to here :)
