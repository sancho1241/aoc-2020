== Groovy

Here is another solution written in Groovy.

=== Part 1:
Each passport is checked for all needed fields.
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=isPassportValidPart1]
....
If a field is there is checked by using regex for example like this:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=getByr]
....

=== Part 2:
Each field needs an additional validation:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=isPassportValidPart2]
....
This is done by adding some checks like this:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=byrValid]
....
