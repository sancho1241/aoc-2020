== Day 4: Passport Processing

This solution is written in Groovy.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4 .
The source code can be found at https://github.com/docToolchain/aoc-2020/tree/main/day04/groovy/rdmueller .

For execution enter `./solution.groovy` in the command line.
This is possible because I looked up the right shebang for the first line of the file to tell bash to use groovy.

=== Read File

I parse the input to a list of maps.

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=readInput]
----

=== First Star

Let's iterate through all entries and validate them by checking the needed fields.

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=star1]
----

=== Second Star

I converted the rules mainly to reguular expressions.

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=star2]
