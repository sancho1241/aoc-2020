== Day 15: Rambunctious Recitation ==

Rust solution for https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/15[AoC 2020, Day 15]

Run solution with `cargo run` (or `cargo run --release` to see the effect of compiler optimization, saves you some seconds today)

Run tests with `cargo test`

=== Solution ===

The solution idea is to store for every value the last round when it occurred in a map.

The map is initialized with

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=init]
----

Then rounds are played with

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=play]
----

I used the same method to solve both parts 1 and 2. I am sure there is a more elegant solution for part 2.
With compiler optimizations on, brute force solves part 2 in a few seconds...
