== What I learned

. Don't hack, but take a piece of paper and work it through.

== Approach

. I read the file in using .readlines.
. I process the file data. I put the numbers as keys into a dictionary with consecutive
numbers as the values.
. Problem 1 and Problem 2:
.. You just keep track of the last time each number was spoken.
.. For problem 2, I had to refactor since I had some expensive copies of lists /
dictionaries that were not really necessary. And then it ran in finite time.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
