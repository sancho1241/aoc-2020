== Part 1

Had a bit issues with the _when exactly do I update the last seen_ entry but with a few minutes of debugging got it working on the tests.

@startuml
skinparam defaulttextalignment center
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
start
:init empty store (Hashmap);
:lastNumber = -1;
while (for turn 0 to 2020-1)
  if (game mode?) then (starting numbers)
    if (turn > 1) then (Y)
      :add lastNumber->turn-1 to store;
    endif
    :lastNumber = starting number[turn];
  else (last spoken)
    if (number is) then (new)
      :diff = 0;
    else (spoken before)
      :diff = turn - 1 -store[lastNumber];
    endif
    :store[lastNumber] = turn-1;
    :lastNumber = diff;
  endif
endwhile
:print lastNumber;
end

== Part 2

At first I thought looping until `30000000` will never work.
So I took a paper and started thinking about ways to improve my code - I hit **run** anyway and was surprised I got an answer after 5 seconds.
Guess no need to refactor after all ðŸ˜†
