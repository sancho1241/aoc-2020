== Day 11: Seating System

This is one of the challenges were TDD would have been handy.
I used some printf debugging to verify that everything works fine.

Due to lack of time I decided to hard copy all required methods for Star 2 from Star1.
There is a lot of duplicate code and technical debt left behind.
I decided to not clean it up seens I'm already 2 days behind and want to catch up.
