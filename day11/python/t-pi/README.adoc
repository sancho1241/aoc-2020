== AoC - Day 11: Seating System
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11

=== Info

Game of Seats: Change free / occupied seats in timesteps, based on adjacent seats' status.
No neighbours -> empty seat gets occupied
(3 + star) neighbours -> occupied seat gets empty

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.

.Star1: Find amount of taken seats in stable distribution
. Iterate through timesteps
. Compare iteration with previous floor plan
. Count seats

.Star2: Modify seat counting to line of sight neighbours
. Extend neighbour testing by linear scaling until seat or end-of-boat is found
. Modify rule2 to be dependent on star

=== Learned today

* list.copy() only works as intended (by me) with immutable elements
* import copy & copy.deepcopy(list) required
* first experiments with maps were quickly thwarted by list of lists ðŸ™„
