== AoC - Day 17: Conway Cubes
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17

=== Info

No more game of life; this gets serious - or even hyper-serious :)
3D Game of Life, with rules:

* "neighbor" = -1 .. +1 in any direction
* active cube with 2 or 3 neighbours -> inactive
* inactive with 3 neighbors -> active

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.
Starting point: AoC2020-day11...
Convert data to dict {(coordinate tuple): status = 0 or 1}
Define initial limits set for all considered dimensions

.Star1: Boot 6 cycles and count active nodes
. Iterate through timesteps, blowing up dimension limit slowly by 1 in every direction per step
. Count active nodes after initial boot sequence of 6 iterations

.Star2: Refactor for 4 dimensions
. Only little refactoring needed to consider 4th dimension

=== Learned today

* Looked up Conway Cubes
* Remember the limits of range(). Had to add several +1's... ðŸ™„
* Getting better still at comprehensions
