How does it work: +

A kind of rework of day11's algorithm, had to find out how to increase the unknown space outside by extending grid by add additional layer turn by turn.

Just an enhancement of part1, replacing Triple by Quadruple. Quadruple is not provided by kotlin, but stackoverflow helped :-)
