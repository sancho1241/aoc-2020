a| as you can clearly see, I just noticed that I am not a web designer - at least not for an X-Mas theme ;-) ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„ ðŸ¤£ +
  you can do test driven development with bash!

a|  eagerly waiting for day01, today I tried to use gitpod.io. After some difficulties at staring, I managend to contribute my day00 solution completely via gitpod.io.
 It's an amazing solution with many features making (my) work more easy.
 Many thanks to Ralf, how took the time to help me over the first hurdles!

=== Day 01

a| http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP330] lets you execute Java like a script... finally, we've got Java-Script :-D

=== Day 06

[cols="1,10"]

a|{anoff}
a| Using an explicit `return` in a ruby `map{}` lambda causes the entire function to return, not just the lambda ðŸ˜”
a| You can remove duplicate (adjacent) word characters using regex `.gsub(/(\w)\1+/, '\1')`
|====

=== Day 09

[cols="1,10"]
|====

a|{anoff}
a| Indexing an `Array` in Ruby is only possible with single integer indexes or a `Range` object. Using an `Array` to index an `Array` is not possible.
a| Ruby has fun `Vector` and `Matrix` operators that would have been fun to play with if you need multiplications instead of sums.
a| TDD or die! When I don't test stuff I always overlook details in the puzzle that are hard to debug later on. Test early, test often.
|====

=== Day 16
|====

a|{anoff}
a| Setting up a debugger is worth ith.
a| There is an important difference between `Array.fill(<value>)` and `Array.map{|v| <value>}` if your value is an empty Array. The first one creates an Array where each element refers to the same new Array (_fill by reference_), whereas the latter creates a new Array for each element in the parent Array - what you usually want.

=== Day 19

a|{anoff}
a| Tests lie! Even if everything is green your code might still be doing the wrong thing.
a| Regular Expressions are powerful..and more performance efficient than I thought.
