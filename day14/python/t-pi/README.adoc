== AoC - Day 14: Docking Data
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/14

=== Info

Ferry Docking - Bitmask Fun

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.

.Star1: Add the numbers from memory, after storage through dominant bitmask and sum up
Straightforward:

. Map values with mask
. Add to 'mem' dict at found address
. Sum up

.Star2: Add the values to masked address list, sum up
. Identify all 'X' in masked address
. For each 'X' add two more addresses to list ('0', '1') and run address list for next "X" in all addresses
. Store values in 'mem' dict and sum up

=== Learned today

* First `re` usage - finally :)
* Loop over all 'X's is better than first recursive approach
