This solution is written in python.

Run using:

$ python solution.py


=== First Star

The solution is straightforward.
Note that the mask-computation can be simply emulated with an "or" followed by an "and"
(where we regard the "X" as "1" in the "and", and as "0" in the "or")

```python
def update_bitmask_1(new_mask):
  and_mask = int(new_mask.replace('X', '1'), 2)
  or_mask = int(new_mask.replace('X', '0'), 2)
  return or_mask, and_mask

def update_mem_andor(mem, loc, val, or_mask, and_mask):
  mem[loc] = (val | or_mask) & and_mask
  return mem
```

=== Second Star

After pondering far too long about how to generate 2^n and/or-masks from a mask with wildcards and then
using our solution for star-1, we re-implemented everything from scratch, using very simple but stupid
list-comprehensions to get our result-bitstring with "X"s. Then we use a recursive generation of all possible
results where "X" is replaced by "0" or "1".
