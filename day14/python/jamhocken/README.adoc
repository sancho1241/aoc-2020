== What I learned

. The problem itself was fairly straightforward. My solution isn't super elegant, but works.
. I finally started testing using pytest.

== Approach

. I read the file in using .readlines.
. I process the file data. I put the codes into a list of tuples.
. Problem 1:
.. If the code is "mask", update the mask.
.. Otherwise, write the value to the dictionary representing the memory using the mask rules and address.
. Problem 2:
.. If the code is "mask", update the mask.
.. Otherwise, find all of the relevant addresses using the mask.
.. Add value to the dictionary at all of those addresses
.. Be sure to hit all of the permutations of bit combos when applying the mask.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
