== Day 13: Shuttle Search

This was quite straight forward.
For some reason I did not think of using the modulo operator to get the waiting time.

Oh boy. I spent a lot of time with this task.
Brutforcing/itterating it? Does not work due to runtime.
Optimzing the runtime? Does not help.
I then tried to use some math based on the smallest common multiple to figure out how often two lines fullfill the matching criteria.
It was my idea to concatenate those values to get the final result.
But I got something wrong and it did not fully work out.
In the end I had to look at other solutions. Thanks to https://twitter.com/jamhocken[@jamhocken] I finally was able to solve it.
But I think my intial approach was already getting close.
