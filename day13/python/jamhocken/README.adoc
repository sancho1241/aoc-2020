== What I learned

. If brute force doesn't work, think about the problem itself before trying to optimize your run time.

== Approach

. I read the file in using .readlines() and immediately put the earliest departure into a variable.
. I process the next line of the file. I put each bus ID and its position in the ID list (counting x's) into a tuple in a list.
. Problem 1:
.. I just use a modulo to find the right bus. 
. Problem 2:
.. Brute force is a really bad idea.
.. Key Insight: Go through the problem iteratively. Find the solution for just the first 2 IDs. Any solution will be that timestamp + a multiple of those 2 IDs.Then find the timestamp that includes the 3rd ID. etc.
.. I put in some extra logic for the pathological case that the timestamp could be zero.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
