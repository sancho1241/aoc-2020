== Day 13

This solution is written in python.

Run using:

$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
$ python solution.py

This day it is all about modular arithmetic --
we use the "sympy" library to make our solution very short.

=== First Star
For the first star, just note that for timestamp t, we have to compute
-t modulo the bus-id (for all bus ids) and take the minimum.
The "-" is important since we want to see when the NEXT bus will arrive.

=== Second Star

This is almost exactly the statement of the Chinese Remainder Theorem: We are
looking for the smallest x such that 
$x \equiv v_i\ (\mathrm{mod} n_i)$ for coprime n_i.
Using sympy.ntheory.modular this solution is one call to "crt".
Note again that the v_i are the negatives of the positions in the bus-sequence.
The output of the crt-function will be the solution x and the lcm of the moduli.
