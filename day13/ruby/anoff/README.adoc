== Part 1

Created a little function that calculates the time until next departure for a given bus.
Played around with ruby array magic and voilÃ  pretty easy solution for part1.

== Part 2

Ooof.
This was more difficult than I would like to admit.
First started looping with dT of the first bus but realized this brute force won't finish.
Actually had to peek at a solution and still failed to implement it correctly.

TIL: need to brush up on maths and CS basics.. ðŸ˜”
