== AoC - Day 10: Adapter Array
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10

=== Info

'Joltage' adapter ladder with only 1-3 jolt difference each for device with max(adapter)+3 jolts

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.

.Star1: Find a joltage ladder with *all* adapters for my underpowered device and multiply 1- with 3-step-count
. Sort list
. Check validity (max difference == 3)
. Count 1's and 3's
. Return

.Star2: Find all valid combinations of joltage ladders and count
. Recursive hell again...
. Lean onto day09: Filter list to only valid adapters
. Recursively run through the list and hope to get the counting right :D
. Worked with tests, but WAY TOO SLOW with full puzzle input

.Star2 - more efficient solution: 
. Search for segments where difference < 3. 
. At difference == 3 there is a bottleneck where all paths cross.
. Use function get_all_ladders only for segments and multiply results.
. Returns count in ms :)

=== Learned today

* Getting a bit more steady with recursions
* Don't trust test only - might still not be fast enough...
