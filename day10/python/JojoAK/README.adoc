. clean up input by converting it to integer values and sorting it
. Part 1
.. go through input and check if the next elements value is 1, 2 or 3 higher than the current elements value.
... if it is, increment the corresponding counter
... if it is not, break
. Part 2
.. create a new list which contains the differences between elements values
.. creata a new list which contains the length of consecutive differences of 1
.. multiply the possibilities of the different lengths
