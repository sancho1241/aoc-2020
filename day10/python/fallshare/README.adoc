== Day 10: Adapter Array
 
=== Star 1
Calculating the histogram.

=== Star 2
 All adapters in the box where the next adapter has a jolt distance of 3  must be in the adapter chain.
 Otherwhise no chain can be formed. Those adapters can be seen as seperators that can be used to split down the big bag of adapters into smaller lists of adapters. 
 The possible combinations for those smaller list can individually be calculated. 
 In the end the amout of combinations of the sublist is multiplied to get the total number of possible combinations
