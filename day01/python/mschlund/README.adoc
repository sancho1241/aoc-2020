== Day 01

This solution is written in python.

The problem is (almost) the k-sum problem for k=2,3 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3SUM) but we search numbers that hit the target of 2020.

Run using:
$ python solution.py

=== First Star

This can be solved easily via a set that contains the "still missing amounts to reach the target", for each number we read, we check
if it is in the "missing amounts" (target - number), if so we have found our two numbers: the current number, and the "missing amount".

=== Second Star

The simplest solution is similar to the one looking for two numbers, but this time we iterate through all pairs of numbers in the input (this could be optimized still -- but there is a quadratic lower bound on the runtime so quadratic is ok ^^).
