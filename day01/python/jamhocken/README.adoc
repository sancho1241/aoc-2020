Trying to get back up to speed with basic programming...

== What I learned

. That you cannot just copy a list to another list (you just make a new
reference to the same list.)
. That you have to be careful if you start removing values from a list
that you are enumerating with.
. Probably all of that is obvious, but it cost me some time to figure out.

== Approach

Brute force. I just take the first value and enumerate over the rest of the
values to check for the match. With a 2nd nested loop for the check of the
sum of three values. That's it.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[]
....
