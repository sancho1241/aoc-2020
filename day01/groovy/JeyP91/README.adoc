== Groovy

Here is another solution written in Groovy.

=== Part 1:
Just iterate over all numbers in two nested loops to sum each number with each other number.
Each number has to be summed only with each following number. Therefore I can initialize the second index with 'i + 1'
.

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=loopsPart1]
            ...
        }
    }
....

=== Part 2:
Same as part 1, just with three nested loops.

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=loopsPart2]
                ...
            }
        }
    }
....
