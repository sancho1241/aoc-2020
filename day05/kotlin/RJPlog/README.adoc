=== First Star

How does it work: +

I wrote a function reading the puzzle input line by line. After recognising, that the puzzleinput is simle a binary format, I replaced for every line's input "F" and "L" with "0" and "B" and "R" with "1". Then the `String` is converted to a binary `Int`. The function returns the max value of the calculated seat ID's.

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

Here all seat ID's are stored in a list. As a function input, solution of part1 is used to count down. If you do not find a seat, this is your's.
