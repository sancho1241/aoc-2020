== Groovy

Here is another solution written in Groovy.
First I split the input into a list with seat strings:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=splitInput]
....

=== Part 1:
Each seat string is converted into a binary number and then parsed as an Integer
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=getNumberFromSeatString]
....
Each seat number is collected into a list and then the highest number of the list is returned:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=getMax]
....

=== Part 2:
Transform each seat string to the number by using method from part 1:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=getMissingSeatTransform]
....
Iterate over all seats and check if seat is in list of seats. If seat is not included, return it:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=getMissingSeat]
....
