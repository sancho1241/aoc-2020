== Day 5: Binary Boarding

This solution is written in Groovy.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5 .
The source code can be found at https://github.com/docToolchain/aoc-2020/tree/main/day05/groovy/rdmueller .

For execution enter `./solution.groovy` in the command line.
This is possible because I looked up the right shebang for the first line of the file to tell bash to use groovy.

=== Decoding

This day I start with a method which converts a boardingpass (bp) to a tuple (row, col, id)

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=decodePass]
----

=== Star 1

Now iterate through all boardingpasses to find the highest ID

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=star1]
----

=== Star 2

Let's first get a list of all IDs.
Then, iterate over all IDs to find the empty seat. 
Since I already have the highest ID, I only have to skip the first seats.
