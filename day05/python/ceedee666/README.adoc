== Day 05

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths


=== Idea

The important thing to notice with day 5 is, that the seat ID are binary numbers.
To convert them to decimal numbers one first need to map the letters F, B, L, R to
0 and 1. 


=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day05.py --help`
