== Day 5: Binary Boarding

Day 5 is pretty much about handling binary numbers.
Theoretically one could just ignore the information about rows and columns for this day.
But based on my last year experience with AoC I decided to spent some time to also decode the row and column information.

By replacing the characters with their binary representation (e.g. B = 1, F = 0) and converting the result strings into integers
the required numbers could easily be retrieved.

The rest of the tasks is solved by storing all seat ids in set object and using set object methods to extract the required information.
