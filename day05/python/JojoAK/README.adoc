*General remark*
Unfortunately it took me some time to get to the simple solution seeing the location of the seat as two binary numbers...Once I noticed, the implementation was rather simple :)

*First star*
achieved
1) replacing "B" and "R" by 1 and "F" and "L" by 0
2) splitting binary string to row and seat string 
3) convert binary strings to decimal numbers
4) calculation of seat ID, replacing the current one only if the new one was higher 

*Second star*
achieved (using most of the solution of part 1)

difference to part 1:
1) instead of replacing the current seat ID if the new one was higher, I wrote all seat IDs to a list
2) sorting the list
3) checking for each element if the following elements value is +1
