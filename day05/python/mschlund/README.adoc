This solution is written in python.

Run using:
$ python solution.py

The central idea is that seat-numbers are just binary
('F'/'B' are 0/1 and the same for 'L'/'R').
The python "int"-function can decode strings if given
the base as seconday parameter (2 in this case).
```python
def decode_seat(line):
  row_binary = line[:7].replace('F', '0').replace('B', '1')
  col_binary = line[7:].replace('L', '0').replace('R', '1')
  row = int(row_binary, 2)
  col = int(col_binary, 2)
  return row, col
```

=== First Star
We simply decode all IDs from the row/col extracted from the seat-number
and then compute the maximum of this list of IDs
(yes for just computing the max we would not need to store all the IDs
but the input is small and there is still part2)

=== Second Star
We simply sort the list of IDs and look for a pair of IDs that
differs by exactly 2 (if the exercise is framed correctly,
there should only be exactly one of them and we check this.
