=== Rows, seats and ids

I did a quick check if FB & LR correspond to 0 & 1 respectevely and they actually do.
So `BBFFBBF` equals `1100110` and can be interpreted as binary.
Rows and seats are calculated for testing reasons, but the id can be calculated the same way.

I was going to check the ids for continuity but in the end brute force seemed reasonable enough.
