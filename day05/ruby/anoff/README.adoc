Puzzle: https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5[Binary Boarding]

== Part 1

Was unsure how to do the _split list in half_ thing at first.
But turns out the ruby array indexing works great for this use case.
Together with some array `.map` magic this was a straightforward implementation.

Only fuckup on my side was that I first ran the solution with input from a previous day and had to add some debug messages to realize it.

== Part 2

Surprised at first that the first 13 rows are empty when looking at the output, the solution was simple.

== Solution

[source, ruby]
....
include::solution.rb[]
....

=== Test cases

[source, ruby]
....
include::solution_test.rb[]
