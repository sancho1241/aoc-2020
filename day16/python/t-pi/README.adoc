https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16

=== Info

Foreign Ticket Garblage: Deduce fields on illisible ticket from statistics.

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.
Data is split into three blocks + bonus block (all integer values as int)

* Rules: dict {field name: [(range limits),]
* Bonus block: set with all ranges combined
* My ticket: sorted ticket data list
* Statistics from other passengers' tickets: list of sorted ticket data lists

.Star1: Compute ticket error rate from invalid tickets
. Run all tickets agains all-ranges-set
. Sum up invalid numbers and sort out invalid tickets
. Return sum

.Star2: Identify ticket fields and multiply 'departure' fields
. Build dict {column index in sorted ticket data: [matching rule names]}
. Clean dict by combing out all rules with only one matching rule
. Identify 'departure' fields' indexes
. Return product of my ticket data at found indices

=== Learned today

* More features of list, set and dict comprehensions
* Avoiding again to use `re`... ðŸ˜Œ
