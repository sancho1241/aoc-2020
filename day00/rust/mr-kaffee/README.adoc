== Day 0: Hello World ==

All days should run using `cargo run`.

My hello world prints Ferris:
....
This year I became a Rustacian!
    _~^~^~_
\) /  o o  \ (/
  '_   Â¬   _'
  \ '-----' /
....

I also plan to add some simple tests based on the example data from the puzzle descriptions which can be executed using `cargo test`.

Tests are implemented in the same source file with the code in a separate `tests` module which is excluded from the regular binary:

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tags=test]
....
