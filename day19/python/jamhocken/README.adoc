== What I learned

. I worked some more with sets in Python today.

== Approach

. I read in the data and "process" it.
.. I put the rules into a dictionary with list of lists as values.
.. I put the patterns into a list.
.. I also check which rules contain only the letters "a" or "b". These are put into a set.
. I create a (large) set containing all valid patterns based on the rules.
. For Problem 1, you just check if each pattern is in the set of valid patterns and sum those.
. For Problem 2:
.. The rules now have the special property that all patterns must end with
at least one pattern from rule 31 (n times). Preceded by at least one more pattern from
the rule 42 (n+1 times).

The hardest part was figuring out that last part. Once that was clear, it was
straightforward.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
