== Day 9: Handheld Halting

This solution is written in Groovy.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9 .
The source code can be found at https://github.com/docToolchain/aoc-2020/tree/main/day09/groovy/rdmueller .

For execution enter `./solution.groovy` in the command line.
This is possible because I looked up the right shebang for the first line of the file to tell bash to use groovy.

=== Parsing Input

With the experience from last year, I expect that we will build a full blown virtual machine again.
So, I need a good parser for the opcodes.
But I also decided to copy and paste the virtual machine every day to see it grow.

Here is the parser:

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::cpu/Parser.groovy[]
----

and this is my cpu for today:

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::cpu/Vm.groovy[]
----

As you can see, I will use packages and classes from now on for my groovy scripts.

=== Star 1

Let's just follow the instructions

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=star1]
----

=== Star 2

Let's mutate the source until we get an exit.

[source,groovy, linenums]
----
include::solution.groovy[tags=star2]
