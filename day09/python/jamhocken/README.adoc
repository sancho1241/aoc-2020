== What I learned

. This one was straightforward at least if you do it brute force.

== Approach

. I read the file in using .readlines.
. I process the file data. Just take each line and turn it into an integer.
. For part 1:
.. I filled a list with the preamble. And I use a window of that length to go through the data and check the sums against the value after the window in a while loop until the condition is met.
. For part 2, I iterate over 2 indices and create the sum of all entries in that range until I find a sum that equals the solution to part 1. And then use those indices to find a min and max over the codes in that range and add them.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
