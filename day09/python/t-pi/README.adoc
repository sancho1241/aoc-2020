== AoC - Day 09: Encoding Error
https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9

=== Info

Hacking eXchange-Masking Addition System code from plane.
Fibonacci-like series. Every number from line 26 must be composed from any two different previous 25 numbers.

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line.


.Star1: Find the first number not following the XMAS rule
. set trackback variable (5 for testing, 25 for 'real thing')
. Function for sublist with trackback length to check if two numbers summing up are found
. Run through list with fixed sliding window of length trackback for function
. Provide first non-matching code

.Star2: Find *contiguous* range to sum up to found non-matching code
. Reduce list to members < code
. Run through list with increasing window until either sum is found or depassed
. Return window to calculate min+max sum

.Bonus: After a question in slack I actually tried to get my version working with a non-contiguous solution within the list
. Recursively run through list
. Reduce goal by current num, reduce list from elements > goal and re-run function
. Returns first matching set - after long seconds of waiting...

=== Learned today

* Look up the friggin' words that are not crystal clear in the puzzle text
* Lost lots of time for a function to find any set of number summing up to code
* Then stumbled over the ambiguity in test results...
* ...but in the end fought through manual tree walking, yeah!
