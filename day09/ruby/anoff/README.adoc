Puzzle: https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9[Encoding Error]

== Part 1

Decided to implement the low level tests as well for the moving window validator and paid off I would say.
First validated my `validNumber?` method and then went on to do the looping and in the end my first syntax-free solution worked correctly!

Had some issues with indexing arrays (only `Range`s work but not arrays of indexes).

== Part 2

Wow... one time I did not TDD my code and I ran into the same problem as always.
Overlooked one part of the puzzle definition - in this case that the final sum needs to be the **smallest and largest** and not the **first and last** element.
First had a wrong result for part2 then decided to implement a test for part2 solution and quickly realized what was going wrong.
